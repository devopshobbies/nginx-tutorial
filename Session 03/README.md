## Create a HTML File

In this section, we'll create a simple HTML file that we want to serve using Nginx. You can use any text editor to create your HTML file. Here's a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Static Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Static Page which Created via Vahag for DevOps Hobbies!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple static HTML page served by Nginx via Vahag for DevOps Hobbies.</p>
</body>
</html>
