## Basics of HTTP Protocol

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. In this section, we'll explore the fundamental components of the HTTP protocol.

### Schema

The URL schema indicates the protocol being used, such as "http://" or "https://."

### Domain

Domains, in the context of HTTP, are used to specify the website or server you want to interact with. Domains are an integral part of URLs, and they help route your requests to the correct destination.

### HTTP Version

HTTP exists in different versions, with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 being the most common. Understanding the version used is crucial for compatibility.

### Methods

HTTP requests use methods to specify the action to be performed. Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

### Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. For example, 200 means success, 404 indicates not found, and 500 represents a server error.

### URI

The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is used to identify resources on the web. URIs include URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URNs (Uniform Resource Names).

### HTTP Headers

HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. They can include data like content type, encoding, and caching instructions.

### HTTP Body

The HTTP body contains the actual data being sent with the request or response. For example, in a POST request, the body may contain form data or JSON payloads.
