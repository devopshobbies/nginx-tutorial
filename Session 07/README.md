# Nginx Tutorial - Session 07: HTTP Protocol 02

Welcome to Session 07 of the Nginx Tutorial, where we'll continue our exploration of HTTP load balancing. In this session, we'll dive into reverse proxy basics, demonstrate a reverse proxy setup, discuss the use of backup servers, handling down servers, and demonstrate various load balancing algorithms.

## Reverse Proxy Basics

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and a web server, forwarding client requests to the web server and returning the server's responses to the clients. It's a critical component in load balancing and web application security.

## Demo Reverse Proxy

In this section, we'll walk through a practical demonstration of setting up a reverse proxy using Nginx. We'll configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for a web application, showing you the step-by-step process.

## Backup Servers

Having backup servers is essential for high availability and fault tolerance. We'll explore the concept of backup servers and how they can be configured in a reverse proxy setup to handle failovers.

## Handling Down Servers

In a real-world scenario, servers can go down for various reasons. We'll discuss strategies and configurations to handle down servers gracefully and distribute traffic to the available ones.

## Demo Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancing is about distributing traffic efficiently across multiple backend servers. We'll demonstrate different load balancing algorithms, such as Round Robin, Least Connections, and more. You'll see how these algorithms affect the distribution of client requests.

## Conclusion

Understanding reverse proxy basics, configuring reverse proxies, managing backup servers, and handling down servers are essential skills for anyone working with web infrastructure and load balancing. Additionally, comprehending load balancing algorithms helps optimize the distribution of traffic.

We hope you find this session informative and practical. Stay tuned for more sessions in this Nginx tutorial series.
