## What is Health Check

Health checks are a vital part of monitoring the status and performance of web servers and the services they host. They're designed to verify that the server or service is operating correctly and handling requests appropriately.

## Different Kinds of Health Check

There are various methods and types of health checks used to ensure the health and proper functioning of servers. These checks can be active or passive and are integral to maintaining system reliability.

## Passive Health Check

Passive health checks typically involve monitoring the server's responses and status without actively sending requests. They rely on observing the server's behavior to determine its health.
